Chapter 1: Introduction

Welcome to Lue AI — your terminal eBook reader with modular Text-to-Speech and a rich Textual UI. This sample lets you practice navigation while hearing the instructions read aloud. You can pause/resume with "p" and quit with "q" at any time; your place will be saved.


Chapter 2: Navigation

Practice sentence-level navigation: press "j" for previous sentence and "k" for next sentence. To jump to the top visible sentence on screen, press "t". For paragraph navigation, press "h" for previous and "l" for next. You can pause/resume TTS with "p" — Lue remembers exactly where you were.  


Chapter 3: Page and Scroll Controls

Scroll without losing the highlighted sentence being read. Press "i" for page up and "m" for page down. For fine control, use "u" to scroll up or "n" to scroll down. Manual navigation via keys/mouse/trackpad pauses auto-scroll; press "a" to toggle auto-scroll and return to the highlighted sentence. "y" jumps to the beginning and "b" jumps to the end.


Chapter 4: Table of Contents

Open the Table of Contents with "c". Use ↑/↓ to navigate chapters, press Enter to jump, and Esc to close.


Chapter 5: AI Assistant

Press "?" to open the AI assistant and ask questions about the current passage. Set the environment variable GEMINI_API_KEY to enable this feature.


Chapter 6: Mouse Actions

If your terminal supports mouse input, you can click on any sentence to jump to it instantly. Use the mouse wheel or trackpad to scroll through the text, or click on the progress bar to skip directly to that position in the book.


Chapter 7: Ending the Session

When you are ready to stop reading, press "q" to quit. Your place and your reading mode will be saved automatically, so you can resume later without losing your spot.


Enjoy your reading!
